1. Installing the environment for MinGW-w64-i686-cmake

I installed the MynGW-w64 starting from MSYS2

http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/

I followed this procedure (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30069830/how-to-install-mingw-w64-and-msys2):

a. Download MSYS2 from this page (choose 32 or 64-bit according to what 
   version of Windows you are going to use it on, not what kind of 
   executables you want to build, both versions can build both 32 and 64-bit binaries).
   
b. Use c:\msys64 as main installation directory

c. After the install completes, click on the newly created "MSYS2 Shell" 
   option under either MSYS2 64-bit or MSYS2 32-bit in the Start menu. 
   Update MSYS2 according to the wiki (http://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20installation/) 
   (although I just do a pacman -Syu), 
   ignore all errors and close the window and open a new one, 
   this is not recommended and you should do what the wiki page says).

d. Install a toolchain:

   a) for 32-bit:

    pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-gcc
    pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-toolchain
    pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-zlib mingw-w64-i686-cmake
    pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-i686-libusb
 	
   b) for 64-bit:

    pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
    pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
	pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake
	pacman -S --needed --noconfirm mingw-w64-x86_64-libusb
	 
	 
e. Install the further tools needed from the "MSYS2 Shell":
   
    pacman -S --needed --noconfirm autoconf
    pacman -S --needed --noconfirm git



2. Build the software

Below the procedure used for 32 bit build is described (again, please note 
that "32 bit" in this context means that the executables produced are 32 bit.

2.1 Open a Win32 session
    In "All Program" , "MSYS2 64 bit" submenu click on "MinGW-w64 Win32 Shell"
    
2.2 Check whether the prompt reports MINGW32: 	
	user_name@machine_name MINGW32 ~
	
2.3 Extract the source
    git clone https://github.com/amontefusco/extio-iw0hdv.git
	
2.4 Build it	
    cd extio-iw0hdv
	git checkout mingw64
	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake ../ -G "MSYS Makefiles" && make

2.5 the executables are found in build/airspy build/hpsdr build/perseus, copy them in the Studio1/HDSDR directory 
    removing the leading prefix "lib" 
	
	
	
3. Known issues:

3.1 git gui is not working as is: for remediation see http://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/discussion/general/thread/1bf2e8a6/

3.2 for reasons still unknown, the executables produced don't work on Windows XP
